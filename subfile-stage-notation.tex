  We need to define notation for these three {\moves} within a {\interval}. We will use $\BegStge$ as a marker for the {\move} before shocks have been realized, $\MidStge$ to indicate the move in which the choice is made, and $\EndStge$ as the indicator for the situation once the choice has been made.
